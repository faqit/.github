# FAQIT!! TECH 

---

That's my GitHub, where I contain some of my works.  
I'm - Network engineer, that want to become Linux engineer too.  

I like open-source stuff, that's why this page even exists. Some day there will be unique product, but now be content with what you have here, haha  
Anyways, I'm trying to repeat everything I ever saw with my own hands. Like websites, some programs, even viruses!  
Here you can find my scripts, templates and anything I decide to add later.

## My projects

- [XRAY](https://github.com/faqit/k8s-vless) â€” k8s config to create your own VLESS VPN cluster based on XRAY
- [FAQIT.TECH](https://www.faqit.tech) - Still in development
